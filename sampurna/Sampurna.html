<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>
Sandeep Maheshwari is a name among millions who struggled, failed and surged ahead in search of success, happiness and contentment.<br>Just like any other middle class guy, he too had a bunch of unclear dreams and a blurred vision of his goals in life.<br>
All he had was an undying learning attitude to hold on to. Rowing through ups and downs, it was time that taught him the true meaning of his life.<br>Apart from being a successful entrepreneur, he is a guide, a mentor, a role model and a youth icon for millions of people all over the world.<br>
People love and adore him for his great mission of making everybody believe in them and helping people to make their life 'Aasaan' (Easy).<br>His unshakable faith in the divine power grants him strength to thrive.<br>Being at the helm of success, it is quite astonishing to know that money does not lure him.<br>His vision is to ignite and inspire the entrepreneurial spirit of tomorrow's leaders and to help them succeed.<br>
